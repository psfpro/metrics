// Package infrastructure represents infrastructure layer.
//
// This layer includes components for database access, file system manipulation, network communication,
// and other foundational services required by the application.
//
// Use the abstractions provided by the infrastructure package to interact with system resources and external services.
// This promotes a clean separation between the application's core logic and its dependencies on external systems.
